# 30DayReadmissionProject
This was my capstone project for my graduate degree
Determined the leading variables of readmission from a hospital database with 70,000 clinical patient records of diabetics from 2008-2018. After considering the relevant fields for testing (number of procedures, number of medications, age, gender); Linear regression, Logistic regression, Decision tree and Random forest tests were performed to predict 30-Day hospital readmissions. Model provided the business understanding that diabetic patients with larger quantities of procedures and medications were more likely to be readmitted within 30 days of visit.
